													<h3>Essence</h3>
												</header>
												<p>My name is Anna McDermott. I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, though am an avid traveller with a goal to see as much of the world as possible. I graduated from the University of Washington in Tacoma with a Master of Science degree in geospatial technologies in August 2018. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, taking walks, and playing with my cats, Monroe and Lady Marilyn Grey.<br><br>

												My passion for wildlife and conservation has given me countless amazing experiences. I am lucky to have worked at a wildlife rehabilitation sanctuary, a zoo, and in the fields of South Africa and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The desire to contribute to conservation work led me to a GIS program that opened my eyes to a new and exciting path, sparking my enthusiasm to pursue further geospatial studies.<br><br>

												Another love of mine is music. I grew up singing and playing viola, and while in college, I started playing traditional Javanese gamelan. It stole my heart just as it had my dad's (a music/composition professor) decades ago and I have continued to play throughout the years, including a time of study in the city of Solo, Java, Indonesia. While in Washington, I play with the Seattle group Gamelan Pacifica. <br><br></p>

I had known about it my entire life as my dad was a music and composition professor, but was thrilled to finally play come college.
